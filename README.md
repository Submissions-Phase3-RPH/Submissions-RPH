## Project: AI/AR for Police Training

### Problem Statement

Modernizing police training is crucial for effective law enforcement. Traditional methods have limitations in replicating real-life situations, providing personalized feedback, and maximizing the learning process. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies offers a transformative solution to this problem.

#### Specific Challenge

Develop an AI/AR simulation model prototype to revolutionize police training, focusing on situations like mob control, Naxal operations, and potential attacks. The challenge lies in building a realistic, immersive, and adaptive training model that bridges the gap between theory and practice.

#### Key Issues

1. AI/AR is not currently used in police training.
2. Initial models resemble video games – should be more realistic.

### Solution Requirements

Digitalize/Augment the Mob Control Drill used by police using augmented reality to provide police personnel with a near-real feel of dangers connected and linked risks while handling and dispersing those crowds and at the same time ensure their safety.

#### Expectations from the Solution

1. Enhanced officer readiness and situational awareness.
2. Reduced training costs through virtual exercises.
3. Better alignment with evolving law enforcement issues.
4. Realistic examples for diverse situations.
5. Ability for multiple players to act in tandem.
6. Comfortable use of AR glasses for an accurate training experience.
7. Real feel in terms of sound, weather, wind, etc.
